# CompTIA Security+ Inspired Projects

Welcome to my **CompTIA Security+ Inspired Projects** repository.This is a collection of projects I created from scratch, inspired by the concepts and skills I am learning while studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
1. Reinforce my understanding of cybersecurity concepts through hands-on projects.
2. Share my projects with others who are also learning cybersecurity or preparing for the CompTIA Security+ certification.
3. Provide practical examples of how the theories and principles in Security+ can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ“˜ About the Projects

Each project in this repository focuses on a specific topic or domain from the CompTIA Security+ syllabus. Some examples of topics include:
- **Network Security**: Creating tools to simulate and secure a network environment.
- **Threats and Vulnerabilities**: Demonstrating how to identify, exploit, and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Identity and Access Management**: Building secure authentication and authorization systems.
- **Cryptography**: Implementing encryption and decryption methods to secure data.
- **Risk Management**: Designing policies and systems to assess and manage risks.

> These projects are entirely my own creation, designed from the ground up based on what Iâ€™ve learned and how I interpret the material.
